# Shift Scheduling Project

In the dynamic and fast-paced environment of hospitals, efficient planning is paramount, especially when it comes to scheduling staff for various shifts. **Shift Schedule Microservice** offers a robust solution tailored to the unique challenges faced by healthcare institutions. Designed with Node.js, gRPC, GraphQL, and REST, and enhanced with Kafka for seamless communication, this microservices-based application empowers hospitals to streamline their scheduling processes effectively. It consists of three microservices: Employee, JobPlanning, and AlerteMsg.

This README file provides an overview of the project and other relevant information.

## Features
- **Microservices architecture** with gRPC, GraphQL, REST, and Kafka
- **CRUD operations** for Employee, JobPlanning, and AlerteMsg microservices
- **Communication** between services using gRPC and RESTful APIs
- **GraphQL endpoint** for flexible querying and data manipulation
- **Kafka** for message queuing and asynchronous communication between services
- **MongoDB** as the database for storing data.

## Technologies
- Node.js
- gRPC
- GraphQL
- RESTful APIs
- MongoDB
- Kafka

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 16.14.0)
- npm (version 8.5.2)
- MongoDB (version 5.1.6)
- GraphQL (version 16.6.0)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/malakaydi/Shift-Scheduling-Project.git
2. Install the dependencies using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install

## Usage
### Start the Microservices
Start all microservices and the gateway in this order:
```bash
nodemon employeeMicroservice.js
nodemon jobPlanningMicroservice.js
nodemon alerteMsgMicroservice.js
nodemon apiGateway.js

```
The microservices should now be running, and you can access them using the provided endpoints.

### Start Zookeeper and Kafka Server
To start Zookeeper, navigate to the Kafka installation directory and run the following command in a terminal or command prompt:
```bash
./bin/windows/zookeeper-server-start.bat config/zookeeper.properties
```
After starting Zookeeper, you can start the Kafka server by running the following command in a separate terminal or command prompt window:
```bash
./bin/windows/kafka-server-start.bat config/server.properties
```
## Running Services
- **Employee Service:** Runs on port '50053'
- **AlerteMsg Service:** Runs on port '50055'
- **Job Planning Service:** Runs on port 50052
- **MongoDB:** Runs on port 27017
- **Kafka:** Runs on port 9092
- **API Gateway:** Runs on port 3000

## Testing
- To test the REST endpoints, use Thunder Client or Postman.
- To test using GraphQL, use Apollo Server with the URL: http://localhost:3000/

## API Endpoints
### Employee Service
- **GET /employee:** Retrieves all employees from the database.
- **GET /employee/:id:** Retrieves a specific employee by its ID.
- **POST /employee/add:** Creates a new employee in the database.
- **DELETE /employee/:id:** Deletes a specific employee by its ID.

### Job Planning Service
- **GET /jobPlanning:** Retrieves all job plannings from the database.
- **GET /jobPlanning/:id:** Retrieves a specific job planning by its ID.
- **POST /jobPlanning/add:** Creates a new job planning in the database.
- **DELETE /jobPlanning/:id:** Deletes a specific job planning by its ID.

### AlerteMsg Service
- **POST /alerteMsg/send:** Sends an alert message to a recipient.
- **PUT /alerteMsg/update/:id:** Updates a specific alert message by its ID.

## Database
The project uses MongoDB as the database system. You can set up MongoDB locally or use a cloud-based MongoDB service. Make sure to update the database connection configuration in the project files accordingly.
